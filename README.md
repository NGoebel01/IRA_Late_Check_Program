# IRA_Late_Check_Program

This project was created to check the late status of IRA contributions by an employer so that corrections could be made to any late contributions. For this type of account, a contribution is considered late if it is contributed later than 30 days after the end of the month in which the employee would have been paid that amount. With this information, I was able to download histories of employee and employer contributions and import them into a Jupyter Notebook and MySQL.

Late contributions were found and presented to the employer.

Both the Python program and SQL query return the same information, but the SQL query was much easier and quicker for this situation.
